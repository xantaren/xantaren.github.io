          <h3 id="a-now-page">A now page?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes, a <strong>/now</strong> page. As none of you may know, I've
            deleted all social media apps from my phone since the beginning of
            2024 (except LinkedIn), but I still feel like I should leave bread
            crumbs as to what I'm up to, so yeah, a now page. Think of it as
            Facebook on tranquilizers, with posts that only come once or twice a
            year.
          </p>

          <h3 id="steam-summer-sales">Steam Summer Sales</h3>
          <p>
            I picked up Baulder's Gate 3 during Steam's summer sale for 20% off
            last week. To be honest, I was a bit worried that a turned-based
            story driven game like BG3 would be too slow paced for my likings,
            but turns out the pacing isn't an issue at all. I actually take a
            long time to end each turn in combat because there's just so many
            things for me to try that I'm getting analysis paralysis!
          </p>
          <p>
            I could go on and on about how hooked I am, but that would take away
            my time I could be spending in game, so I'll leave it at that.
          </p>

          <h3 id="work-goals">Work Goals</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Learn Domain-Driven Design (DDD). I blame my lack of understanding
              in the structure and development of SAP Commerce on not having a
              bigger picture in aligning the solution with business needs, which
              make my development process feel like navigating a maze without a
              map, and I'm a bit tired of running into the same dead-ends over
              and over again.
            </li>
            <li>
              Take more initiatives in technical communication. This has to do
              with overcoming imposter syndrome since I never feel like I'm the
              right person to answer questions. There's always this fear of
              &ldquo;what if I do a shit job and fuck up the explanation, blah
              blah blah&hellip;&rdquo; but yeah. Gotta get over that somehow, or
              at least mitigate it a bit.
            </li>
