          <div class="article-content">
            <p>
              I wouldn&rsquo;t say mentoring, but for the past year or so
              I&rsquo;ve been giving my fair share of advice and guidance to
              coding boot camp new grads on how to get hired for junior dev
              positions. Most of them were already half-way there. They had a
              working web app that they&rsquo;d built in camp, and a solid
              resume that featured their skill set. All I had to do was get them
              to send out more applications, follow up on more companies, boost
              their confidence for interviews, and they&rsquo;d have a foot in
              the door.
            </p>
            <p>
              For 2024 though there&rsquo;s just one little problem: there are
              no doors.
            </p>
            <p>
              I know the market is bad. My last employer shut down over 90
              previously open positions at the start of last year and reopened
              only 10 this year with zero junior dev positions. Many of my
              friends that started as a junior dev job hopped this year, only to
              find that their previous companies never filled their spots. So I
              can just about imagine how much the demands have dipped compared
              to when I started out.
            </p>
            <p>
              But hearing how Shane, a 2024 coding boot camp new grad who has
              better performance and a stronger portfolio than when I just
              started out in 2021, still looking for a junior frontend position
              after three whole months, made me realize the market looks even
              grimmer for those that are kicking against locked doors. At one
              point, Shane was even gaslit into considering a position that
              offered barely above Taiwan&rsquo;s minimum wage because &ldquo;no
              other companies are hiring juniors and you should be grateful that
              we&rsquo;re even offering you a job.&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p>
              I know job hunts are no picnics, but it shouldn&rsquo;t have to
              feel like navigating a minefield. I can only speculate why this
              year is so much tougher than the previous years to land an
              entry-level dev job:

              The Great Maybe: Post-Pandemic Hiring
            </h3>
            <p>
              When Covid was at its peak, companies rolled out work from home
              policies to prioritize employee safety and well-being. For many of
              these companies, it was meant to be a temporary measure to ensure
              business continuity amidst the turmoil.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the dust settled, while some companies scuttled their workers
              back to office, many discovered benefits of remote work such as
              heightened morale, lower turnover rates and potentially improved
              productivity. This led to a shift in the hiring process where
              recruiters are encouraged to look for candidates beyond the local
              talent pool, and prioritize hiring professionals with experience
              to mitigate the increased cost of remote on-boarding processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite the wider talent pool, companies are now casting a wider
              nets with larger mesh to prioritize cost-effective developers with
              some experience, leaving out entry-level candidates with little to
              no experience.
            </p>

            <h3 id="double-edged-sword-the-rise-of-llms">
              Double-Edged Sword: The Rise of LLMs
            </h3>
            <p>
              While we’re generally optimistic that large language models (LLM)
              aren&rsquo;t replacing developers any time soon, it’s hard to say
              the same for devs that has only recently acquired the skill of
              programming and has little understanding in data structures and
              system design.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let me quickly tell you that I wouldn&rsquo;t fully entrust
              ChatGPT to write business logic and complex implementation. I
              would need to review the code meticulously, make a few tweaks and
              then let someone else review it before I let it into the codebase.
            </p>
            <p>But couldn’t the same be said about junior devs?</p>
            <p>
              Of course I know that with adequate nurture, junior devs may one
              day flourish to become outstanding tech leads. But from the
              corporates’ perspective, there&rsquo;s also nothing stopping the
              same devs from becoming outstanding tech leads somewhere else,
              which makes companies more hesitant of hiring for
              &ldquo;potential&rdquo;.
            </p>
            <p>
              It&rsquo;s not just tech either, this phenomenon has been observed
              in professions outside of tech as well: Attorneys are becoming
              less dependent on associate attorneys for conducting legal
              research, sales executives no longer look to sales assistants to
              draft their cold email templates, and junior graphic designers
              aren&rsquo;t tasked to come up with concepts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite all this, I firmly believe that LLM induced hiring freeze
              is only transitory.
            </p>
            <p>
              LLMs are just tools. They can spark inspiration in creative tasks
              and empower teams to innovate faster, but they’ll always be more
              effective when wielded in the hands of experts. And the sooner
              companies realize that all expertise starts out as a struggle in
              an entry-level position, the faster the hiring freeze will thaw.

              Flooded Market: The Price of Over Hiring
            </h3>
            <p>
              For a long time, the tech industry held a reputation of being
              accessible only to the intellectual elite, the smartest of the
              smarts. To become a software engineer, you had to prove that
              you’re worthy by either holding a CS degree or having a track
              record of hacking the Pentagon since you were 14.
            </p>
            <p>
              As computers became smaller, they went from sitting on your lap to
              fitting in your pockets. Software became ubiquitous and people
              realized you could build a billion-dollar company out of a single
              app. The world saw a shortage in programmers for the first time in
              80 years, and had no choice but lower the barrier of entry
              (again). Rather than spending four years on a CS degree, you could
              pick up the bare minimum and become tech worthy in just six months
              at coding boot camps.
            </p>
            <p>
              For years the boom seemed unstoppable, not even the pandemic could
              stop it, if not making it even more explosive. The world was on
              fire while tech companies were high on its fumes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Eventually the fire smoldered and the high died down, there came
              economic downturns, shifts in consumer behavior, political
              emphasis on privacy. Consequently, companies found themselves
              either falling out of favor with shareholders or are no longer
              profitable. In 2023, business analysts probably discovered “The
              Mythical Man-Month” by Fred Brooks and many programmers were not
              pushed, but teleported back into the job market by their big
              corporate employer. Smaller companies on the other hand opted to
              having their entrance barred to applicants.
            </p>
            <p>
              This year, it seems that things are looking up as developer jobs
              are back on the menu, with a bit of a twist: many companies are
              now seeking junior-level developers with at least two years of
              experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ve always regarded these sorts of job postings as haha
              programming memes, but seeing them now on LinkedIn rather than

              It&rsquo;s certainly a depressing year to be a tech rookie trying
              to break into the industry. I honestly don&rsquo;t know if I would
              make it this year, rather than three years ago. But I just want
              whoever&rsquo;s reading this who&rsquo;s struggling to get into
              the industry, or looking back on the year 2024, to know that
              it&rsquo;s not your fault. I’m sure you did your best, but the
              circumstances just weren’t in your favor.
            </p>
            <p>
              Years ago, I aspired to become a marketing specialist or a
              business analyst dealing in international commerce. I took
              business and marketing classes in college, worked overseas for a
              short period to prime my resume, and even took a sales job in
              attempt to expand my network. And then Covid happened, job
              postings halved in the span of a month. The other half were
              postings that companies put out and forgot about. I didn&rsquo;t
              know how long this would go on, all I knew was I had to find a way
              out and at the time tech seemed like a more promising industry
              than commerce or manufacturing. So I took the leap and signed up
              for free Android app development classes offered by The Taiwan
              Ministry of Labor, and the rest is history.

              Career path are seldom linear. Sometimes shit happens, life throws
              curves balls that casually swerves into your face, but it usually
              narrows down just three paths:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Wait it out: If things are manageable for you, wait it out. In
                the meantime, fill your time with things you can bring up in
                your interviews when you’re asked about the employment gaps.
              </li>
              <li>
                Get aggressive: Reach out, follow up, expand your area of
                search, make connections, whatever it takes. The more lottery
                tickets you have, the higher your chances are of winning the
                lottery.
              </li>
              <li>
                Explore other possibilities: The time and money spent on
                learning will always be an investment, not a sunk cost.
                There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with deviating from the path you set
                out to take.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              As Walt Disney said: “Around here, however, we don&rsquo;t look
              backwards for very long. We keep moving forward, opening up new
              doors and doing new things, because we&rsquo;re curious&hellip;
              and curiosity keeps leading us down new paths.”
