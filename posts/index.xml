      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say mentoring, but for the past year or so I&amp;rsquo;ve been giving my fair share of advice and guidance to coding boot camp new grads on how to get hired for junior dev positions. Most of them were already half-way there. They had a working web app that they&amp;rsquo;d built in camp, and a solid resume that featured their skill set. All I had to do was get them to send out more applications, follow up on more companies, boost their confidence for interviews, and they&amp;rsquo;d have a foot in the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For 2024 though there&amp;rsquo;s just one little problem: there are no doors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Any of you remember cookie clickers?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/vvrEPKT.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Cookie clicker&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a refresher for how the game works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time you click, you get a cookie. The more you click, the more cookies you have. The more cookies you have, the more you&amp;rsquo;re winning (not at life, but winning is winning). Cookies are a form of currency in this game and with enough hard-earned cookies, you can actually purchase automated workers the baking (clicking) for you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
